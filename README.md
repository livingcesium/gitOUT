A demo of an educational coding puzzle game platform. Uploaded here for preservation 

Project worked on by Ugochinyere Okogeri, Jesus Barrera, and myself during the CodeNext Launch program. I worked on the illustrations and the game portion, Jesus worked on the front-end, and Ugochinyere worked on ideation and marketing. To be honest, the whole team collaborated in such a way that giving these roles is a bit of an understatement. Tons of credit goes to Jesus and UG, as well as the folks behind CodeNext Launch.

As for their contact information, I'm uncertain if these emails are up to date (but they're worth a shot):  
```
jesus.barrera@csedge.org  
ugochinyere.okogeri@csedge.org 
```  
  
If those don't work and you want to get in touch with them, contact me here and I'll see if can get their updated contact information
